         <p><strong>The GeoTag-X pilot project</strong> will teach volunteers to perform in-depth analyses of the media (photos, video, and audio) coming out of a disaster. </p>
<p>Disaster response efforts have to analyse massive amounts of data that are produced during a crisis, an overwhelmingly difficult task. Crowd-sourcing has already been used during different events to help filter, categorise, and map this data, and has proved to be an invaluable resource.</p>

<p>

We want to teach you, our volunteers, to recognise the important information in a photo and create relevant, structured datasets that can be used by those working on the ground in the response.<br>
Disasters could include earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, along with more slow moving events such as drought, climate change, and pollution. Analyses therefore could cover topics as diverse as environmental conditions, health, agriculture, and engineering. <br>
<br><strong>How do I get started?</strong><br>
